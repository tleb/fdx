How the example works:

1. Start the server
2. Start the client
3. When the connection is open, client sends a 'print' command to the connection
4. Server receives it and sends a 'print' command to the client then answers the command
5. Client receives the 'print' command and answers it
6. Client receives the answer to his previous command
7. Server receives the answer to his command
